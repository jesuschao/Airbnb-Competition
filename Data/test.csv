Living on Wooster Street I was a local for a week, a fantastic experience. I would love to offer this kind of experience to my guests when staying in Amsterdam.
The house is mainly occupied by me, my son and Bonnie the cat, but we love to entertain friends and family with food and stories, so the house can be quiet as well as very lively. A family home in short ;-)
Our room for rent is on the second floor of a 4 story house, and with it's own bathroom on the same floor, it is all rather private and relaxed, for the guests as well as us. We live on the two top floors, just a shout away if any help is needed. 
My personal interests are art, photography, film and design, and I love to show my guests the local hotspots. New shows and exhibitions, exciting places to go for shopping, coffee or food, I am happy to share if you want to know. 
I travelled west as far as San Francisco and east as far as Varanasi. Both ways there was always a 'friend's connection' to help out with local stuff. This was before Airbnb existed, and now through this organization I can maybe be that connection for you. Happy to help.

I'm Jacqueline, 35, live and work in Amsterdam as a nurse. 
Love to travel, see and explore another world, cultures and habits. 
I try to make a long trip every year, or at least a few short trips. The most memorable trip was the one to Cameroon. But i am also a huge fan of Asia. Next on the list is South America.
Next to traveling i like to cook, wander around, take photo's, catching a good film, host or attend dinnerparty's. 

What i love about airbnb is the experience of seeing and feeling the city/village as a local. Therefore i'd like to give fellowtravelers something back. 
Because my travels are often for a longer period of time and therefore i am not allways at home to welcome guests personally (unfortunately), i asked 'the friendly host' to take over when i am away. I have good experiences with them and i trust them to make the stay just as personal as i would do so myself.

In 2010 was het zover. Na het huren van een eerste appartementje midden op de Wallen (Amsterdam Centrum) en de stad verder leren verkennen, vond ik ruim een jaar later ons huidige appartement in Amsterdam Oud-West. Een van de meest populaire buurten onder de Amsterdammers. Met veel plezier heb ik met andere studenten, waaronder vriendinnen, hier gewoond. Sinds 2019 woon ik samen met mijn vriend.
Sfeer, gezelligheid en warme kleuren voeren de boventoon in ons ruime appartement. Het interieur wisselend uit ikea, new design en vintage treasures zijn met veel liefde uitgezocht. De ruime eet- en woonkamer geeft je, na een lange dag door de Amsterdamse straten, het gevoel van thuiskomen. De identieke slaapkamers geven een ultiem gevoel van hotelkwaliteit. De badkamer is voorzien van toiletartikelen en uitgerust met een douche en ligbad. Samen met de luchtzuiverende planten kunt u helemaal tot rust komen. 
Voor de thuischef is de keuken van alle gemakken voorzien. Vanwege de middag- en avondzon kunt u zowel voor als achter op het ruime balkon dineren. 
Bedankt dat u de tijd heeft genomen om ons beter te leren kennen en wij hopen u snel te mogen ontvangen. U bent meer dan van harte welkom!

Born and raised in Amsterdam,  traveling the States for work for the last couple of years.

This lovely low- maintenance city is a metropole within a village; it combines the thrill and diversity of serious metropoles with the cosy and safe qualities of a village. It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. 

I have always been fascinated by storytelling and political campaigning and managed to make a living out of that fascination. I used to work in political campaigning but switched to journalism in 2016. As a free lancer, I travel the United States a lot and touch base in Amsterdam about 6 months a year. 

Furthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. In 2016, I started surfing and have taken every chance ever since to catch waves.  

I started booking with airbnb in 2011  and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place  decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world in 2014. I really do believe the sharing experience adds to the any stay, anywhere. My home is not a holiday rental - I care to share it with travelers who enjoy the sharing and local kind of travel and treat a home that same way.

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

Hi there!
I’m Gilles. I’m born in Paris, have grown up nearby Avignon, have lived in Marseille, Nice, Nancy and Paris to eventually end up in Amsterdam.
I’m a creative and work in advertising. I’m really into sport, music, wine and travel. I live in the Dam for 6 years and I can safely say that I know the city very well.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

We have 3 boys, in the age of 8,6 and the little one is 2 years old.

In 2013 we bought the boat "" The Calidris"". The main reason to live on a boat was to stay in the city, but still had enough space and above all, freedom. It feels like a little community in this street, because the boat people hang out together, help eachother and know eachother well.

We are very happy to live in such a special place in Amsterdam, enough space, nice views, but still connected to the city! We like cooking together, traveling with our 3 boys, designing our home or making trips with our camper.

In 2014 we started our B&B. Where you sleep now, it used to be the captain's cabin. We immediately removed the stairs, so we do not miss the space at all. It as always a dream for me to run a little boutique hotel. Nowadays we don't run a hotel, but a pittoresque B&B, which we really enjoy. It is fun to meet people all over the world who mostly have a great time at our boat. When you would like to see how houseboat-people live just knock on the door and we will show you around!

Enjoy your stay!

Around the corner you will be amazed by the view of the Nieuwe Prinsengracht and the Westertoren. To experience Amsterdam in all its glory, you're at the right place at B&B 305. Enjoy the liveliness of the city when you step out, and take a comfortable break when you step in. I'm sure you will enjoy your stay at B&B 305!

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

While travelling I am always moved by the hospitality of people and appreciate when people open up their homes. I am crazy about movies and outdoor festivals. There are plenty here in Amsterdam. I lived for many years abroad in countries in Africa, Middle East, South America and even in New York. As a tenant I cared for other peoples' goods. I even often repaired broken things in the houses where I lived. I am moved and inspired by world leaders who make a difference in improving the world. I try to contribute to this by my jobs and am dedicated to empower those who have less access to basic goods like water of education.


Ik geniet van Amsterdam, maar houd ook erg van reizen. Door reizen heb ik geleerd hoe leuk het is als anderen hun huis openstellen. Ik ben gek op film en buiten festivals. Daar hebben we er genoeg van in Amsterdam. Tijdens mijn jarenlange wonen in landen in Afrika, Midden Oosten, Zuid Amerika en New York heb ik als huurder vaak kapotte dingen gerepareerd. Ik ben sociaal bewogen en kom op voor de zwakkere buur in de wereld.

We have a bathroom with a bathtub and shower.
Washing machine is also available on the ship.
We have two cats. They are both lovely and will stay on the ship.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

The answer is simple: it didn't exist. It was custom build. In October 2011 the ""Tasmania"" arrived in Amsterdam. Our dream came true and we would love to share that dream with you. 

We are hard working film and television professionals. Before building this boat we used to travel a lot. Now every day feels like a holiday. When we are at home we'll be happy to welcome you and tell you everything you want to know about Amsterdam and the boat. But most of the time we're out working. It will make your stay more private. We hope the studio apartment appeals to people who like to travel independent, just like us.

We are Bas and Mirte, around 35 yrs old and we live in Amsterdam with our two little kids ages 2 and 4.
Our motto for life is work hard, play hard: Mirte is a marketing manager in FMCG and Bas is owner of a paragliding school. Enough about work; we both love to travel, far away or closeby. Bas loves paragliding and visits the beach and dunes at least once a week to fly; even more he loves paragliding in the Alps, so if he's not enjoying Amsterdam; chances are you'll find him in Austria or Italy. I myself love cooking, running (great combination ;-)), shopping and reading. And I hate how boring my life looks compared to Bas' ;-). 
Oh and we do have other things in common, we both love watching movies and series!

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,20,20,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",Oud-Noord,,52.38976,4.91841,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,,1 private bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Air conditioning"", ""First aid kit"", ""Hangers"", ""Paid parking off premises"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Shampoo"", ""Shower gel"", ""Waterfront"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Smart lock"", ""Bed linens"", ""Heating"", ""Wifi"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Essentials""]",1,1125,1.0,1.0,99.0,99.0,1.0,99.0,,t,20,46,73,259,2021-12-06,20,2,0,2019-08-24,2019-10-22,4.45,4.65,4.7,4.75,4.5,4.45,4.35,Exempt,t,20,4,0,0,0.72

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already.

My husband - Frans - and I have been living in Amsterdam for over 10 years. For us it's the most wonderful city to live in!

I'm Belgian and Frans is a Dutchman. Together we've done quite some traveling. We met in Mallorca, lived together in Ghent, Belgium for 3 years, lived in Istanbul, Turkey for 1/2 year, extensively travelled through Italy & Spain and in 2013 we came back from a 1 year trip around South-America. Though having seen all these beautiful places, Amsterdam has stolen our hearts and we can't imagine living anywhere else but here. Cycling through the city, across the bridges and next to the canals always puts a very large smile on our faces!

I'm Micha from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

After having had 1 year off, I start working again in Amsterdam.

I left my city & job to be able to study Spanish & travel through Middle and South America. I stayed at several Airbnb places and  enjoyed it big time! Nice locations, clean and proper rooms with especially very friendly local hosts!
Now my own apartment is ready too (just recently moved),  I'll definitely list it too.

The combination of a open and friendly culture, beautiful environments and nice people are the perfect combination to me when traveling.

In general: I like to travel, as we all do ;)
For the rest: cooking
sports: kite-surf, ice-skating (the Dutch way) & running in the Amsterdam parks, skiing, swimming & driving my motorcycle
And last but not least exploring nightlife.

If you have a nice play to stay, I would glad to be there!

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,20,20,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Zuid,,52.35184,4.85199,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,,1 private bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Air conditioning"", ""First aid kit"", ""Hangers"", ""Paid parking off premises"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Shampoo"", ""Shower gel"", ""Waterfront"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Single level home"", ""Smart lock"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Bed linens"", ""Heating"", ""Wifi"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Essentials""]",1,1125,1.0,1.0,99.0,99.0,1.0,99.0,,t,27,57,87,272,2021-12-06,36,3,1,2019-04-17,2020-02-20,4.78,4.89,4.86,4.89,4.89,4.78,4.53,Exempt,t,20,4,0,0,1.12

Great that you are having a look at my personal profile. 

In short something about myself; I work and live in Amsterdam since 2009. During work days I have to go right through the city center on my bike to get from “de Pijp”  (the area I live) to the office next to Central Station. It entertains me to see all the people with their own goals, planning of the day and personal expressions. In Amsterdam you never get bored with all the entertainment / shopping area’s, musea, and great terraces with the canal sceneries on the background.

In addition, the city allows me to variate on the restaurants I like to go to, to meet up with friends and relax in its surrounding nature.  As I like to exercise 3 to 4 times a week it is great  to have the Sarphati park next door and greater green areas just outside the city center. 

Conclusion, I thoroughly enjoy living in Amsterdam and would highly recommend it for both business and/ or pleasure.

When I stay on my sailing boat for a longer period (my favourite place is The Wadden Sea), it is fine to share my house with likeminded people, who feel the wish to energise: in the house and garden itself and the nature in the direct environment, as well as in the city centre with all the beautiful cultural events.",within a few hours,100%,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/406f9c53-b7f2-4317-82e9-d0a33f956126.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/406f9c53-b7f2-4317-82e9-d0a33f956126.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",t,t,"Amsterdam-Zuidoost, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",Gaasperdam - Driemond,,52.30448,4.97025,Entire townhouse,Entire home/apt,4,,1 bath,3.0,3.0,"[""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Pocket wifi"", ""Stove"", ""Washer"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Iron"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hangers"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Free street parking"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Wifi"", ""Essentials"", ""Crib"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Shampoo"", ""Kitchen"", ""Private entrance"", ""Hot water"", ""Bed linens"", ""Microwave"", ""Cable TV"", ""Bathtub"", ""Host greets you"", ""Oven"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Heating""]",7,30,7.0,7.0,1125.0,1125.0,7.0,1125.0,,t,10,15,15,169,2021-12-06,3,0,0,2017-08-01,2018-08-14,5.0,5.0,4.67,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,03639D02D64FF7DA4F9C,t,1,1,0,0,0.06

My name is Sander and since 10 years I lecture economics at university. Before that I worked for several companies in the sales department. 

In between jobs I backbacked through Asia, Central and South America for 1 year, so you can imagine my interest for travelling! I have experienced the most amazing things in which people always made the difference. In that perspective my long time friends describe me (yes I've asked!) as an adventurous, social, sincere, funny, energetic guy that loves good wine and good food in good company. 

After renting out my apartment for a few years I can honestly say that I enjoy hosting people and advising them on what to do while they are here. Since this is my personal home, it's always my goal to achieve a certain connection with every guest in order to trust them with my property.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,20,20,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Centrum-Oost,,52.36712,4.90697,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,,1 private bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Air conditioning"", ""First aid kit"", ""Hangers"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Shampoo"", ""Shower gel"", ""Waterfront"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Smart lock"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Bed linens"", ""Heating"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Wifi"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Essentials""]",1,1125,1.0,1.0,99.0,99.0,1.0,99.0,,t,13,41,64,244,2021-12-06,6,1,0,2019-10-20,2019-12-07,5.0,4.83,5.0,4.83,5.0,5.0,4.67,Exempt,t,20,4,0,0,0.23

In my humble opinion I am very privileged to live in one of the most special places in the world: Durgerdam (Amsterdam - North).  On a historical dyke (former fisherman village), next to the IJsselmeer lake, in the typical Dutch rural landscape, but still very close to the unique city of Amsterdam.

As television producer I did (and do)  travel  a lot and I am always a fan of remarkable, unique accommodations to sleep and to stay in. Especially  excited do I get  when they are placed in the middle of nature or at unique locations.  Inspired by my visits to those spots, I decided to build my own little house, with all the comfort you need on a special place; my hometown Durgerdam/Amsterdam North.

Together with an architect we created the Tiny House. An authentic small wouden house, where I hope a lot of other people feel at home and can enjoy the green area & of course Amsterdam..

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

I also love to travel. I have been to Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam, China, Panama, Laos, Nepal, India en lot's of places in Europe. 

For you as a guest i don't have to tell you about how great it will be for you to stay in Amsterdam! From my place to the centre of Amsterdam it's 10 minutes with the tram or, if you dare, on the biclycle :-)

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

After living in Amsterdam for 10 years, we bought a ranch (without animals) from 1927 in Den Dolder. We love the peace and nature and you can really escape your busy lifes and that is what we would like to share!

We live in the centre of the Netherlands where you are close too city's like Utrecht, Amsterdam and Amersfoort and in the middle of the woods close to lakes and dunes. Hiking, mountenbike and race tracks are very close.

We will most likely be available to welcome you ourselves. I hope the guesthouse is still available for your stay as I am for sure you will have a great time! Let me know if you have any questions!

Welcome on our page! We are in love with our home and would like to share it with you when we are away for business or holiday. 

I am a entrepeneur and boat lover.

For us, the houseboat is one big adventure! We jumped into it and we are 99% finished on how we would like to have it. However, as some of you boat lovers will know, a boat is never finished! You will always need to upgrade something or when you are less fortunate, repair something. 

BUT 99% of our stay at home we feel like we are on holiday! For example when:
- we shower in bright sunlight or underneath the stars! 
- we feed the swans from our own dining table
- we enjoy our privacy with no one being able to watch you
- we are treated with the brightest sunrise or a colorful sunset!
- we snuggle into our very very comfortable extra large box spring 
- when we jump into the water from our own boat!
- shall I go on? :)

Please share our love for water & respect our way of living: being humble and respectful towards nature and the people around you. And we welcome you to our HIDDEN GEM in Amsterdam! 

Any questions? We are happy to answer you! 

See you soon?

I came to his city in 1982 and probably will never leave anymore. I love my city, my house, my family, my friends and many other things. Really Amsterdam, ‘ the biggest village on earth’, offers so many beautiful things. We love to bike down town for coffee, shopping at the organic Noord Market or the so called Nine Streets, strolling in the Vondelpark, going to Paradiso or theatre with our daughters.  Many times we feel like tourists in our own town! 
I was educated as teacher French and Dutch but switched to the fashion industry as there was not enough work in teaching at that time. As a fashion agent I sell woman clothes to shops. As my business becomes more difficult the last year I decided to start b&b, and I love it. 
I also love to go hiking in the Alps or reading my books in our beach hut  at half an hour from where we live. 
I love going to cinema especially documentaries and art house films, and: yoga, meeting family and friends.

If you stay with us, there is a big chance that you meet my partner Karel as well. His work is project manager for art in public space. He is even a more enthousiatic mountaineer as I am: he also loves to climb the rocks as well. And when I am reading my book he is a probably out for sailing on the sea in his Laser. 
 
My two daughters can give you the best advices where to spend your money with shopping. They are working hard at school and dreaming and saving money for their round-the-world-trip within a few years.

Our two cats like sleeping very much.

In 2013 we bought the boat "" The Calidris"". The main reason to live on a boat was to stay in the city, but still had enough space and above all, freedom. It feels like a little community in this street, because the boat people hang out together, help eachother and know eachother well.

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

Until World War II the area had a sizable Jewish population which included Anne Frank and her family, who lived at Merwedeplein square until they went into hiding in the secret annex located in the Jordan.

I grew up in Amsterdam but never had the opportunity to stay or even visit a houseboat. I stayed here for 10 days at the end of April and was very fortunate to be blessed with great weather. My stay was excellent and the houseboat contributed a large part to that. It is located in one of the best locations of the city: next to the Jordaan and close to the Westermarkt (with Anne Frank house). It is very quiet on the water even though the city is hustling around you. Sitting outside, looking out over the water is a great experience. Weekends the canal is a bit busier with lots of small boats coming through but it create a unique atmosphere that you will not find in any of the hotels. The houseboat itself is unique so it is hard to describe, it is not small, but it does create an intimate atmosphere. I can see it would be great for a romantic stay (even though I stayed alone Lachebekje (zwart-wit)). The layout makes that the sleeping part is separated from the kitchen/living part even though there are no doors between the sections. The bed is excellent, the shower strong and hot, the kitchen fully equipped, lots of books to read and music to play. But most of the time you will be sitting outside enjoying the view of the canal and the sounds of the city. The nights and morning could be a bit chilly but heather worked just fine. I would recommend the houseboat to anyone who would like ta truly unique Amsterdam experience.

What an amazing boat and location! We spent most of our visit sitting on the back deck...and watching the symphony of the city happen around us. The bed was comfy (and I am picky), the fresh flowers were nice. We also enjoyed feeding the momma and daddy ducks with their babies. We will return and we hope the boat is available when we do.

The houseboat was awesome - everything we expected. Fake was a wonderful hosts and the houseboat had everything we needed. We had a small problem with the heat and Fake came over so quickly. It was really a simple button to reset that was all but I hadn't figured it out. The location is fantastic too - really I think best neighborhood in Amsterdam. What a treat to experience Amsterdam this way. I highly recommend it.

El houseboat fue realmente muy confortable , conseguía que te sintieras como en casa y el lugar donde esta situado es simplemente espectacular, cerca de restaurantes, tiendas - se hace hasta un mercado semanal en la zona donde comprar productos de alimentación frescos, bio.....etc Una familia de patos te visita cada día y se mueren por el pan!!!

Es war alles perfekt, die Fotos geben das Boot realistisch wider, Fake war zuverlässig und sehr nett im Kontakt, der Besitzer sehr serviceorientiert und freundlich. Das Bett ist sehr komfortabel, die Ausstattung völlig ausreichend. Die Lage ist wirklich absolut zentral und alles ist fußläufig gut erreichbar. Wir könne die Unterkunft auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen und werden wiederkommen, wenn das Boot frei ist.
