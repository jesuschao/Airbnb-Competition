### OBJECTIVE.

To predict prices of Airbnb apartments in Amsterdam with Machine Learning. To find which model offer best results.

### PROCESS.

I have created two Jupyter Notebooks: One for "training" and the other one for "testing". This has been done to clean and prepare data from both csv's (train.csv and test.csv). Both csv have undergone same transformations but I found clearer proceeding in this way.

After the cleaning and transformation, I trained data with different models to see the results.

### COMMENTS.

In general, there is a small overfitting but, among all checked models, the best result was obtained with Random Forest Regressor RFR().
