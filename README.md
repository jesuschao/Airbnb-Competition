### OBJECTIVE.

This project falls within the framework of a Kaggle competition. The aim is predicting prices of Airbnb apartments in Amsterdam with Machine Learning as well as finding which model offers best results.

### PROCESS.

I have created two Jupyter Notebooks: One for "training" and the other one for "testing". This has been done to clean and prepare data from both csv's ("train.csv" and "test.csv"). The files have undergone same transformations, anyway, I proceeded in this way because I found it clearer.

After having cleaned and transformed data, I trained them with different models to see the results and submitted my prediction.

### COMMENTS.

In general, there is a small overfitting but, among all checked models, the best result was obtained with Random Forest Regressor RFR().
